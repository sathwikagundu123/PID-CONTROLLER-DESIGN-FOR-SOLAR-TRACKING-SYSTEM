PID Controller Design for Solar Tracking System
This project focuses on designing a dual-axis solar tracking system using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to optimize solar panel orientation for maximum solar radiation absorption. The system consists of rotation and elevation mechanisms controlled via a PID loop to precisely track the sunâ€™s position throughout the day.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Dual-Axis Tracking: Adjusts both rotation and elevation for optimal sunlight exposure.
PID Control Implementation: Ensures accurate and stable tracking.
Manual & Auto Modes: Allows user control and automated sun-tracking.
Mechanical Design Testing: Validates system performance in real-world conditions.
Optimized Power Generation: Maximizes energy output compared to fixed solar panels.
ðŸ”§ Methodology
Mechanical Design Testing: Validates the rotation and elevation system.
PID Parameter Tuning: Ensures optimal performance with Kp, Ki, and Kd values.
Performance Analysis: Evaluates system response to sun position changes.
ðŸ“Š Results
The mechanical system functioned correctly based on the designed parameters.
The PID controller effectively adjusted the panel's orientation, improving energy capture.
The system demonstrated accurate and stable sun tracking, enhancing solar power efficiency.
